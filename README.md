# open-ransomware
Yet another fooking repository based on Java. Don't worry, we'll get through this (somehow).

## <u>***DISCLAIMER!***</u>
Do not use any of the following code against anyone for any reason. Only do this on
yourself or on someone that you have full permission to do so.

Full description will come out, when I'll get on the right track of this program. In the meantime,
I will test it only on a VM (Virtual Machine) to not infect myself.
