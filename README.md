# open-ransomware
Yet another fooking repository based on Java. Don't worry, we'll get through this (somehow).

***

## <u>***DISCLAIMER!***</u>
Do not use any of the following code against anyone for any reason. Only do this on
yourself or on someone that you have full permission to do so.

***

Full description will come out, when I'll get on the right track of this program. In the meantime,
I will test it only on a VM (Virtual Machine) to not infect myself.

***

## Setup
The side of your setup is easy. To modify any values, locate the file "inject.cfg" inside
the package "com.bechris100.open_ransomware.res". I will try my best to document everything,
what every line does.

## Install
By now, this will be only tested on Linux systems that use SystemD. Even when people hate it,
SystemD is good, which includes Arch Linux. Arch Linux will be the primary test Operating System
for this cause, following Ubuntu 22.04 LTS, Zorin OS 16.1 and Linux Mint with the Cinnamon Desktop.
Full tutorial on packaging and installation won't be explained now, but you can basically package a
JAR easily.
