# open-ransomware
Yet another fooking repository based on Java. Don't worry, we'll get through this (somehow).

## <u>***DISCLAIMER!***</u>
Do not use any of the following code against anyone for any reason. Only do this on
yourself or on someone that you have full permission to do so.

***

Full description will come out, when I'll get on the right track of this program. In the meantime,
I will test it only on a VM (Virtual Machine) to not infect myself.

## Install
The following code will be only tested on those Linux Operating Systems:
- Ubuntu 22.04
- Arch Linux
- Zorin OS 16.1

They won't be tested on a real hardware, but rather the Virtual Machines via QEMU.
